# "Tools and Approaches for Digital Storytelling"
A workshop offered by Cynthia Heider at Penn Libraries.

## Description 
How can researchers make their scholarship engaging and accessible for non-specialist audiences? Digital storytelling combines narrative techniques with digital tools and multimedia elements to enrich communication about research and ideas and can be implemented widely across disciplines. This session will introduce several digital storytelling outcomes - including multimodal publications, digital archives and exhibits, interactive maps, and podcasts - and some tools and approaches for creating them for your research. Although this event is open to the public, emphasis will be placed on resources and tools that are available to Penn affiliates.
